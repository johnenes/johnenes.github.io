POULTRY ECOSYSTEM CARE (PEC)
CHALLENGE Problem Statement

Poultry farmers in Nigeria are currently experiencing high cost of operation and face a greater risk of business failure. This can be directly linked to feed inefficiency, disease outbreak, poor management system, lack of access to specialized knowledge and innovative practices which reduces profitability. This project aims to bridge the gap by providing professional solutions than enhance productivity, improve flock health, and ensure economic viability of poultry farming operations What the project will not solve While the project will provide comprehensive support to poultry farmers, it will not directly address broader agricultural challenges outside the poultry sector, such as crop farming or livestock other than poultry. The project will also not solve issues related to the overall agricultural policy framework or infrastructure deficits in Nigeria, such as transportation and market access challenges. Additionally, it will not provide direct financial support or subsidies to farmers but will focus on offering expert guidance and technological solutions to optimize existing resources.
